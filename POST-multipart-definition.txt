boundary := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace 

bchars := bcharsnospace / " " 

bcharsnospace :=    DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" / "+" / "_" 
               / "," / "-" / "." / "/" / ":" / "=" / "?" 

Overall, the body of a multipart entity may be specified as follows:
multipart-body := preamble 1*encapsulation 
               close-delimiter epilogue 

encapsulation := delimiter CRLF body-part 

delimiter := CRLF "--" boundary   ; taken from  Content-Type field. 
                               ;   when   content-type    is multipart 
                             ; There must be no space 
                             ; between "--" and boundary. 

close-delimiter := delimiter "--" ; Again, no  space  before "--" 

preamble :=  *text                  ;  to  be  ignored  upon receipt. 

epilogue :=  *text                  ;  to  be  ignored  upon receipt. 

body-part = <"message" as defined in RFC 822, 
         with all header fields optional, and with the 
         specified delimiter not occurring anywhere in 
         the message body, either on a line by itself 
         or as a substring anywhere.  Note that the 
         semantics of a part differ from the semantics 
         of a message, as described in the text.>
